> As part of DGL113 W21 I've been assigned a course project. My project is based on a window pane counting & quote tool that I've invisioned building for my window cleaning business for some time, now. This tool was designed to fit the business needs of [MossAway Services Inc.](https://www.mossaway.ca) and [Comox Window Cleaning](https://www.comoxwindowcleaning.com).

This project, the Window Pane Quote Tool (a placeholder title), was designed to allow a window cleaner to arrive at a customer's house and quickly count window panes of varying sizes and complexity. The tool will automatically tally up the count and produce a rough quote to provide to a customer. In doing so, the evaluator can give a customer an on-the-spot quote with a high level of confidence that all factors have been considered.

In future iterations of this project I plan to build in user authentication and database storage. In this MVP, only session storage will be used to save information during the quote process.
