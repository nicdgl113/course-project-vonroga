This is the initial DGL113 assignment / project repository readme file. When you view this file, it means you have cloned the assignment / project repository. You will add your files and / or modify the existing files. Complete the tasks as required, push your completed work back to GitHub. 

You will also publish your work as a website to be hosted on GitHub.
NOTE: When you view your published website on GitHub, you may likely see this file by default. The URL in your browser's address field would be like, https://nicdgl113.github.io/assn0-practice-dglStudent/. You have a few options to show your web page. 
1) You can manually add the html file name to the end of the URL in your browser's address field. For example, to view a webpage named ct_about.html, you need to add file namme at the end of the URL to make it look like, https://nicdgl113.github.io/assn0-practice-dglStudent/ct_about.html. Of course, your site URL will be different from this one but the format would be similar.
2) Name your home page as index.html and place it in the repository's web folder. This will make it to show automatically when the user browses the site published off your repository.
3) If the home page is not named index.html, you can add an empty index.html file to the repository web folder, then add this meta tag in the head section of the index.html file.
   <pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; url=ct_about.html"&gt;</pre> Instead of showing the index.html, it will redirect the user to ct_about.html after 1 second (NOTE: the number must be a positive integer).
