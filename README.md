# EzEval

Quickly, easily, and accurately quote window cleaning jobs. This project was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of a school project. A [new version](https://github.com/rogadev/ezeval.app) will replace it soon, built with SvelteKit.

## About The App

EzEval is a web app that I wanted to build for my own exterior cleaning company, MossAway Services Inc.. At the time, there was nothing that did what I wanted it to do, how I wanted it done. So, I built it myself.

In the newer version built with SvelteKit, I've added user authentication and database storage. This allows users to save their quotes and access them later. It also allows users to create different price sheets for different types of job. For example, a user can create a price sheet for residential window cleaning, and another for commercial window cleaning. The user can then select which price sheet to use when creating a quote.

The newer version will also allow users to create employee profiles. These profiles can produce a quote using metrics, but doesn't allow them to see the price sheet. This allows users to send their employees to quote jobs without giving them the tools to go out on their own and start bidding jobs the same way.
